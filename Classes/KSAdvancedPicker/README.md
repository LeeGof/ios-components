# KSAdvancedPicker

Many people complain about `UIPickerView` being hardly customizable. `KSAdvancedPicker` tries to overcome its limitations in a straightforward manner as the class is highly based on well-known iOS components (like `UITableView`).

Look at the fancy screenshot, customizations are endless!

`KSAdvancedPicker` works with both ARC and non-ARC projects.
