# UIAcceleration+DeviceAngle

Compute the device 2D angle from `UIAcceleration`. Looking at the device laying flat from the home button: the x is the rotation around the longer display axis (towards left), the y is the rotation around the shorter one (towards the observer). This category is sort of an experiment (probably useless), so there's much room for improvement.
